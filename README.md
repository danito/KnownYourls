# KnownYourls

Plug-in to use your own Yourls url-shortener with Known.

install yourls from yourls.org on your server.

copy the yourls folder to IdnoPlugins and activate the plugin in Known/admin/plugins.

Save the secret token and the url to the yourls-api.php.

Shorten Url is triggered by yourKnown.site/share (use the bookmarklet or the Firefox app). 
It shortens the url you want to share, not the shorturl of your post.
